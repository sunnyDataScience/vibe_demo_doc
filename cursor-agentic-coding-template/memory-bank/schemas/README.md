# Memory Bank Schemas

This directory contains schema definitions for the core files used in the `memory-bank`. These schemas serve as a "contract" for the AI Agents, ensuring they can reliably parse and interact with the memory files.

The `Health Check` step within each command should use these schemas to validate the integrity of the memory files it reads.
